After 3200+ lines of code and 96 hours of work, I finally have something to show for it!

First off, this entire effort is dedicated to the OMC ModPack team (which includes me, :P). O7 to them, and grumpelumpf, the work that you all did over the years on OMC modpack will not be forogten.
  When I looked at the current modpack installers, they all look the same: in size, in UI, and were all made with the inno setup creator. Many describe these installers as "clunkey and slow". Trying to get that perfect mod setup can sometimes take hours. Have you ever had a "modpack setup night"?
  The goal of this modpack is to redefine what a modpack installer can be, while keeping a simple and straightforward interface. Instead of using an inno setup template, I decided to make my own template in Micosoft's C# programming language. Some of the UI features in this modpack are new(tab catagory view), and some are kept in line with previous modpacks (right click to preview).
  The big question: Why would you use this modpack over Aslain's/OMC's/any other inno setup template modpack? Here are a few reasons:
  -New UI: Instead of a giant "list" of hard to scroll mods to select from, the mods are presented in tabs, each tab page being a mod catagory. Xvm has a tab page, garage stats have a page, damagelogs have a page, etc. Also, the "Preview mod" window does not lag when loading pictures, unlike other major modpacks
  -Save mod prefrences: Like omc, you can save your mod selections to a file.You can even use the to automate the install process (more on that later)
  -Performance: The loading and installation times of my modpack vs. other major modpacks are significant, and make finding the configurations you like much quicker. In side by side comparison tests (excluding download speed):
Time from program execution to mod selection on a hard drive:
OMC: 52 seconds
Aslains: 46 seconds
Relhax: 4 seconds - 91% faster

Time from mod selection to install completion (installing the same number of similar mods) on a hard drive:
OMC: 10 seconds
Aslains: 9 seconds
Relhax: 2 seconds - (76-80)% faster

  -Automation: The modpack and be set at command line with a "/auto-install config_file_name.xml" switch to automatcally install the modpack, with your prefrence of mods selected. In this situation, you could install without any interaction, and update all your mods in seconds.

FAQ:
-Why is there such a difference in install times?
 While the major installers are single-threaded, mine is not. What does that mean? Looking at mod zip extraction, for example, when a file is extracted, it is reported to the gui in a syncronus manner. This means that the modpack can only extract as fast as it can pump events to the GUI for each entry extracted in a zip file. This is where multithreading come in. You can create a seperate thread and have it only extract, and asycronously report the progres to the gui. This means three things:
  -The gui is not laggy during install
  -The install is not frozen when the ui thread is blocked, like moving the window for example
  -The extraction is limited to your hard drive speed, not the processor gui reporting speed.

-I have a perfect selection of mods that I want. Can I save this selection?
  Yes. Press the save config button. It will save your config file whereever you tell it to save it. I reccomend you save it in the default folder.

-Do I have to install my personal mods/configs after this is done?
  No! You can put your mods in the "RelHaxUserMods folder", and the installer will install them just like they were regular mods. You can even use it to patch files with the installer's patcher, and install fonts.

-How can I use the "auto-install" option?
  You need to create a shortcut to the application. Right click it, properties. In the target textbox, append "/auto-install config_file.xml", where:
  -"auto-install " (<--note the space, required!) is the command
  -"config_file.xml" is the filename of your saved config prefrence file you made from the mod selection window. The config MUST be in the folder "RelHaxUserConfigs" for this feature to work!

-Why are some mods/configs bolded?
  It means the physical mod zip files eithor don't exist on your disk, or they are out of date and will be updated

The modpack is currently in alpha, proof of concept. I am still adding minor features and adding finishing touches to the application. This means that bugs may still exist. To prevent possible loss of your "perfect modpack configuration" it is reccomended to back it up eitor manually or using the "backup mods" checkbox option.


If you come across one please take one of three actions:
-Reply to this thread.
-Send me a pm.

-(if you're in relic gaming community) send me a slack dm
When you do, please attach two files:
-a screenshot of the error (if able)
-your RelHaxLog.txt file

Fell free to leave feedback, tell me what you think, what should change, etc.

If you want to help develop the modpack, I would be glad for the help and will help set you up with an environment.

If you want to see current progress, take a look at my github repo for it, and the file /bin/debug/relhax_TODO.txt.

Latest release notes can be found in /bin/debug/releaseNotes.txt
