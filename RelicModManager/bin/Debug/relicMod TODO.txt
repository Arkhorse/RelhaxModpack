(critical) test user mods extraction

(normal) add mods to the modpack. Kind of a big deal.
- update the modInfo with mod descriptions and dev urls and stuff
- get all working crosshairs from omc
- then start pmod stuff
- then start xvm config cancer
- then add other mods?

(normal) comment code and put in log outputs (currently done on all files)

(optional) add statistics of how many runs done ever and of what mod
  
(enhancement) keep in mind hashtables instead of giant lists, or implemenet find
  
(optional) have it uninstall only the mods installed
  -save the old patch folders somehow
  -keep a log of every extracted zip entry
  delete every file in the log (if it exists)
  -recursivly delete each folder if the number of files and folders in it is 0
  -read each patch file and reverse the patch
