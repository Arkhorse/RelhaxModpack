(normal) add download file size and time to download to database
- make a database loading application to parse CRC's and file sizes

(normal) add json patcher add mode

(normal) test if json patcher will load individual files (test, nbd if no)

(normal) add mods to the modpack. Kind of a big deal.
- start pmod stuff
- start xvm config cancer (both should be easier with json patcher)

(enhancement) change downloader api?

(normal) comment code and put in log outputs (currently done on all files)

(optional) add statistics of how many runs done ever and of what mod
  
(enhancement) keep in mind hashtables instead of giant lists, or implemenet find
  
(optional) have it uninstall only the mods installed
  -save the old patch folders somehow
  -keep a log of every extracted zip entry
  delete every file in the log (if it exists)
  -recursivly delete each folder if the number of files and folders in it is 0
  -read each patch file and reverse the patch
