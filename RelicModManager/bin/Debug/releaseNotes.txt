-The default and omc legacy ui have been redesigned so that it is more like OMC and straightforward. The only time a mod will be greyed out is if it is actully disabled/broken.
-The preview system has been changed. You can now right click on a mod OR a config to view it's specific description.
-The "Loading" time between mod selection and extraction (where nothing seems to happen) had been reduced by up to 83%. This depends on mod selection.
