Version 23.0.0:
-Large update inbound! The modpack has gone through several changes and has a few new and exciting features!
-The biggest and perhaps most significant is that with the programming concept of recursion, we now can have about 400,000 config sublevels, rather than the 3 we had before!
-The default and omc legacy ui have been redesigned so that it is more like OMC and straightforward. The only time a mod will be greyed out is if it is actully disabled/broken.
-The preview system has been changed. You can now right click on a mod OR a config to view it's specific description.
-The "Loading" time between mod selection and extraction (where nothing seems to happen) had been reduced by up to 83%. This depends on mod selection.
-Other minor bug fixes and enhancements. And of course,
-Updated translations
