Hello Everyone, please welcome the latest and greatest modpack installer version, Version 24!!
A lot has changed in this update:
-The installation process has been completely re-written. Now, the code is much cleaner and the installer is 100% off the UI thread. It is also more efficient
-The method for uniquely storing mod and config names has been re-written. Now, when we change the name of a component, you won't get that annoying "could not find the mod/config with the name ..." anymore
-The feedback on the installer textbox window is now more complete and has more helpful information
-There are now 3 progress bars that show: the total progress, the progress of a specific phase, and the process in that phase (if applicable)
-Loading a preference selection, or clearing your selections, has had the time reduced by about 80%
-Lots (about 500 lines) of dead and inefficient code cleanup
-The uninstaller was built into the installer class, no more duplicate code between the two
-Optimizations to the database parser
-Changed encoding of the log from ASCII to UTF-8-BOM
-Added more exception logging
-Modified the auto-detection to greatly increase the chance it can quickly find your WoT installation
-Modified the Manuel detection so that it can try to locate the WoT folder, but won't cause exceptions
-Updated translations
