Hello everyone, we have a full new release, version 26!!!
  This is the biggest and most significant update yet!
https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/e968183097438e69602cc50b79cdcf08111fc7ee32afe4f3ab04a6803c74e2f8/detection
-The application is now signed with a trusted certificate from the StarCom signing authority! say goodbye to virus and certificate warnings!
-Un-checking all options in the selection list no longer rebuilds the UI, where it does that weird "collapsing" of the window
-The size information of each mod and config is now displayed in the most accurate size (kb, mb, etc), and shown with the local method of display (US decimal is ".", EU is ",")
-Added translations to the installation steps
-Many users missed from OMC the option to load a config from one of the developer team members. That feature is back
-The dependency system has be updated again, so now it can use boolean logic to determine if a package should be installed. For example, you no longer have to specify if you want to "xvm" or "non xvm" version of mirroring the contour icons
-Added the first level of configs to the search bar
-(For database managers) we have now added a GUI for editing the database!

At this time, all OMC and other features have been implemented. We can now focus more on the database and application bug fixes. We hope you enjoy this latest build!
