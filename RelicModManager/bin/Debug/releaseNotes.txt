--UI changes:
-The main form has been completely re-designed so that it uses more pictures and less links
-The media player now has start/stop/pause images instead of translated text
-The Color change code has been completely re-written to be modular and therefore apply to every window without any special patches being required
-The translation code has been completely re-written to be modular and therefore apply to every window without any special patches being required
-Bugs with the color change and border code have been fixed
-A new selection view has appeared: "Default V2". Is is essentially a WPF (new UI engine vs. winforms) version of the default view. This marks the completion of phase 1 of our two phase process to move the application to a new UI engine.
-The margins and padding of the "OMC legacy" view have been changed so that each sub-section does not extend so far to the right (it looked weird)
-The Taskbar icon code has been re-implemented correctly so that it works off of the main window rather than a "backgroundForm" that many people saw
-The parsing of the scaling buttons has been fixed
-Fixed other bugs with selection handling in all views
-Translations have been updated

--Installer changes
-We have written a hotfix for a nasty bug in the uninstaller that would cause the installation to fail. It will be fully fixed when we change UI engines
-Handling of the installer thread is been correctly implemented, it will now say if there was an exception level error during installation
-The json patching process has been minorly re-worked so that it is logged better and will not write invalid json to disk
-Other bugs fixed with the backing up of the current mods directory

--Other changes
-Removed lots of not needed code and embedded resources to free up space and save CPU time
-Re-implemented the saving of atlas files now that WG has moved to DDS images
-The logicalDependency class for using dependencies with boolean logic now can be specified for OR and AND logic, for when other packages are tied to it

https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/28f729992c099f75626229634fda85c1249df0c45e194176ae25c34b5c67421a/detection
--UI changes:

-Fixed bug in legacy view where an enabled component on right click preview would send focus back to selection list, not staying on preview window
-Re-wrote code for how UI controls are translated so that it is modular
-Added working facebook and twitter links
-Other UI code optimizations

--Updater changes:
-Added alternative application update method. It will take longer, but should be more compatible with anti-virus programs

--other changes:
-Added ability to use the beta application and beta database from the advanced settings page. (Command-line versions still work)
-Organized the translations into groups based on where they are used
-Rewrote entire backend tool to update the database, update the application, and clean the online zip folders
-Automated the database update process. It now takes 15 seconds, rather than 15 mins manually

-Fixed bug in default selection view where when selecting a mod in a category view, when scrolling down to preview another, after closing the preview window the selection list jumps back up to that first mod you selected
-Fixed bugs where some UI components would not disable during an install
-Added ability to mark log output statemetns as debug so that they will only show in alpha or beta builds
-Added ability for database editor to auto load databse from command line
-Updated most translations

--Installer changes:
-Added the "_readme" folder to be deleted during the installation process
-Renamed Smart uninstall to default, made it the default uninstall method

Wargaming is releasing a major application version? So can we! May we present to you, version 28!!! (03/17/18)
  This version is packed with new features and cleaner code!

-The class structure for the modpack has changed again. This time it is less complex and makes more sense. There is an abstract class that represents a component in the modpack. That class is then inherited by other classes, being Dependency, LogicalDependency, and SelectablePackage (no need for mod and config seperate classes). The Selectable Package class has a refrence to the coresponding UIComponent, which is what you as the user interacts with.

-The mod selection list code for building and handling logic selections was completly re-written. Before, when you make a selection, the UI cound would be triggered and it would then update the database. This was bad for three reasons:
1: It implies that the UI controls the database, rather than the database controlling the UI
2: The UI and database could get out of sync.
3: For each UI view, the code needs to be written.
Therefore, a new method was made. Now, when you make a selection, it gets updated the database, and then propagates the selection changes throughout the database, which then get reflected in the UI. In other words, the database controls the UI. What you see is what you get.
-The Category system was changed. Categories no longer have a "single" or "multi" selection type, they are now just categories. This means that we can have single and multi mods at the same top level, in the config. This was done by making a top UI component, the category holder.
-The filesize of the database was reduced by about 30% due to making some entries optional. For example, if the mod does not have a version associated with it, the empty entry for it is not written to the database.
-When loading a new selection, it will now check for any invalid entries. An invalid entry, for example, would be if you selected the header for "Arty" in crosshairs, but did not actually select a mod in that list.
-Added new feature: Export mode. It will allow you install your mods to a custom folder. Keep in mind that it therefore will not unpack, patch, or create atlases for stock WoT files. If you select this you know what you're doing.
-Improved smoothness and loading of the audio preview
-fixed issues with getting the WoT version and/or applying the correct version of mods to the specified WoT version, if in test or beta database mode
-Improved compatibility with Windows Proxy settings. It may take an additional 50-100ms to initialize connections
-Renamed "Super Extraction" to multicore extraction
-Removed border and color change options from the default view as they became difficult to maintain and didn't provide much to the modpack
-Fixed bugs and optimized the database editor to take up less code space and CPU time
-Optimized usage of macros
-Fixed issues with lock statements in the install process
-added the file lastInstalledConfig to list of files included in the diagnostic zip
-Fixed bugs with the backend utility database list generator
-Fixed several bugs with the database editor
