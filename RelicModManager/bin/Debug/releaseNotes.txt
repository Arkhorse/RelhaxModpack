Version 19.2:
- Fixed possible exception when "backup mods" is checked
- Fixed bug with the backup mods directory feature
- Fixed bug with both backgroundCopy and backgroundDelete which both improves UI
performance and prevents a stack overflow exception
- In single mod selection tabs, instead of having to manually uncheck a mod to
check another, it now does that for you. (@Rkk1945)
