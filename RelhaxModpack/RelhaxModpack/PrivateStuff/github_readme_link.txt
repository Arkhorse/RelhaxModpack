If you are someone exploring the modpack, then you will find the application won't build without a missing file. This was done on purpose as a security measure.
  To get the application to build, you can delete the refrence to the file, then change all the bad refrences to the class in the code to empty strings.

If you are a member of the modpack team, you need to access another repo in order to make the project work.
